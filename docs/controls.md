## How to Play

### Basic Flow
1. **Navigate** - Use A/D or arrows to rotate your ship
2. **Collect** - Fly near yellow debris to collect it automatically
3. **Deposit** - Enter the green recycler zone and press E to bank points
4. **Avoid** - Red triangle hazards damage your ship
5. **Combo** - Deposit quickly after previous deposit to increase multiplier
6. **Survive** - Don't let HP reach 0, survive until timer ends

### Tips
- More carry = slower movement - deposit often!
- Combo multiplier increases with quick successive deposits
- Combo timer warns you at 2 seconds before reset
- Boost has a cooldown - use it to escape hazards
- Watch for phase change warnings at 2min and 4min marks
